**1. Changing Font Styles**

You can customize the font family, size, and weight of text using the font-family, font-size, and font-weight properties.

**Example:** This will make all paragraph text use the Arial font, size 16px, and appear bold.

p {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

**2. Text Alignment**

Use the text-align property to control the horizontal alignment of text.

**Example:** This will center the heading text.

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

**3. Text Color and Decoration**

Use the color property to change text color and text-decoration to add effects like underlines.

**Example:** This will make links blue and remove the underline.

a {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: none;
}

**4. Text Transformation**

The text-transform property changes the case of text.

**Example:** This will convert the heading text to uppercase.

h2 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

**5. Letter and Line Spacing**

Use letter-spacing to adjust space between characters and line-height to adjust space between lines.

**Example:** This will slightly increase the space between characters and lines in a paragraph.

p {
  letter-spacing: 1px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}

**6. Text Shadow**

The text-shadow property adds a shadow to text.

**Example:** This will add a soft shadow to heading text.

h3 {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

**7. Using HTML Text Elements for Additional Styling**

HTML text elements provide additional ways to style specific parts of your text. These tags offer flexibility in how you highlight, emphasize, or differentiate portions of your content as shown in example 7 (attached).

**Conclusion**

CSS text properties and HTML text elements give you full control over how text appears on your website. Using a combination of these tools allows you to create visually appealing and meaningful content that enhances the user experience. 

Experiment with these properties and tags to make your text stand out and effectively communicate your message. Happy coding!
