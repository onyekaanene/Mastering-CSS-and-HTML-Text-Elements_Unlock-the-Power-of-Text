<!--7. Using HTML Text Elements for Additional Styling

HTML text elements like <span>, <strong>, and <u> provide additional ways to style specific parts of your text. These tags offer flexibility in how you highlight, emphasize, or differentiate portions of your content.

7.1 The <span> Tag

The <span> tag is an inline container used to style specific portions of text within a block element. It is commonly used with CSS to apply styles like color, background, or font changes to parts of a sentence.

Example: The text inside the <span> will appear in red. This tag is particularly useful when you need to style a word or phrase without affecting the entire block.
-->

<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red text</span> inside a paragraph.</p>

<!--

7.2 The <strong> Tag

The <strong> tag is used to emphasize text, indicating that the enclosed text is important. By default, browsers render text inside the <strong> tag as bold, but it can also be styled further with CSS.

Example: The text inside the <strong> tag will appear bold. Using this tag can help convey importance or highlight key points in your content.
-->

<p>This is a <strong>bold statement</strong> in a sentence.</p>

<!--
7.3 The <u> Tag

The <u> tag is used to underline text. While it was previously considered outdated for visual styling purposes, it is now often used to denote important content or links.

Example: The text inside the <u> tag will be underlined. Underlining text can be useful to draw attention to specific words or phrases, but avoid overusing it to maintain readability.
-->

<p>This is an <u>underlined text</u> example.</p>

7.4 Combining HTML Tags

You can combine these HTML tags to achieve complex text styling. Consider the exaple below:

Example: The text inside the <strong> and <u> tags will be both bold and underlined.
